# Jacky's Discord Self Bot

Welcome to the source code of my Discord Self Bot

# Installation

Use [git clone](https://github.com/PepaxJacky/Self-Bot) to install the code.

```
git clone https://github.com/PepaxJacky/Self-Bot
```
###### Or download the file manually

## **MUST EDIT**
```python
chnl_id = "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID_(FOR SPAMMER)"
token = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
t1 = token
h1 = {"authorization": token}
```
You MUST change the values of `chnl_id` and `token` to your Discord channel ID (the one you want to spam) and your Discord token

## If you are using Repl.it...
To store the Token and custom password, you need to create 2 environment files named: `Key` and `token`.

Set value for `Key` to be YOUR custom password to run the code, if you do not like this feature, feel free to remove the code of it. 

Set value for `token` to be YOUR Discord token. Don't know how to get your Discord token? Refer to this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI)
